<p>With over 2 billion users globally, WhatsApp has become one of the most widely used messaging platforms, but it poses challenges regarding privacy since you need to use your own phone number to create an account. However, with the assistance of virtual phone numbers from countries worldwide such as the USA, UK, Germany, and numerous African nations, you can utilize WhatsApp anonymously while ensuring the protection of your sensitive data.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>What Is a Virtual Phone Number, and How Does It Work with WhatsApp?</strong></p>



<p>A virtual number is a phone number that doesn’t require a physical SIM card. Virtual numbers allow users to receive SMS and calls online, providing a versatile solution for various verification needs on apps and websites.</p>



<p>Many people opt for a virtual number for WhatsApp, which operates independently and can be used for registration purposes or kept active for ongoing use. These numbers are globally routed using only the internet and function similarly to regular phone numbers for receiving SMSs and calls.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Benefits of Using a Virtual Number for Your WhatsApp Account</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational Efficiency: </strong>Virtual phone numbers enable you to categorize different aspects of your life for better organization. You can set up multiple WhatsApp accounts, including business profiles, using different virtual numbers for various purposes. Additionally, custom area code phone numbers from different countries offer a local presence worldwide.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quick and Convenient Setup</strong>: The WhatsApp account creation process with a virtual number is quick, affordable, and convenient. You can have a ready-to-use virtual phone number delivered and activated within 60 seconds without any long-term commitments.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Privacy</strong>: Virtual phone numbers provide customization and optimal privacy, allowing you to use WhatsApp freely for personal chats without mixing professional contacts. By avoiding over-exposure of your private mobile number, you can maintain better control over your privacy.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>How to Buy a Virtual Number from <a href="http://shawnsms.com">ShawnSMS</a> for WhatsApp?</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Install WhatsApp: </strong>Ensure you have the WhatsApp app installed on your Android or iOS device, as the desktop client does not support account creation.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Enter Your Virtual Phone Number</strong>: Once you&#8217;ve acquired your virtual phone number from ShawnSMS, enter it into the WhatsApp account creation process. You should receive a confirmation code within minutes, which you can use to verify your WhatsApp account.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Note:</strong> ShawnSMS accepts payments in Naira and cryptocurrencies, offering flexibility and convenience for users.</p>

<p>Shawn-SMS service allows you to receive SMS to a temporary virtual number for verification purposes when registering on social networks, marketplaces, or other online platforms, while this service usually delivers SMS correctly, there can be technical difficulties resulting in users not receiving their codes. In this article, we will discuss the possible causes of problems with receiving SMS from Shawn-SMS and what to do in such cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reasons for not receiving code from Shawn-SMS</h2>



<p><strong>All the reasons why code does not come to a user:</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Some service does not send code<br>Sometimes this can happen due to a technical failure. In this case, you can just request your verification code again after some time passes. But in some cases, security algorithms intentionally block sending a code. This happens if there are many requests from one IP. The algorithms realize that most likely there is registration through special software. What to do in such a situation?</li>



<li>Supplier’s mistake<br>To provide a large amount of numbers from different countries, Shawn-SMS works with thousands of suppliers around the world. At the connection stage we conduct verification and provide detailed instructions. But it is not always possible to track the work of a particular supplier. If the supplier withdrew a card from sale too early, or there are other technical difficulties on their side, SMS from the service just cannot be delivered to Shawn-SMS.</li>
</ol>



<p>The Shawn-SMS service itself only provides the technical base and is an intermediary between a provider and a number buyer. Problems on the service side practically never happen, but technical support always helps to find solutions in any case.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do if you don’t receive code from Shawn-SMS?</h2>



<p>How to solve a not-delivered-SMS problem? If you use an activation, the money for your number will be automatically returned to your balance if code is not received within 20 minutes. In case of a number rent, you can cancel the purchase of the service within 20 minutes by yourself. If a code has not arrived during this time, the money will be returned to your balance. If you did not receive a message, but the money has not been returned, please contact the technical support of the service.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do when Shawn-SMS does not send code?</h2>



<p>What to do when Shawn-SMS does not send code?<br>In most cases users can solve such problems on their own. If the tech support is processing a large number of requests, it will be even faster to do everything by yourself. Here are the most effective tips on how to solve the problem with not delivery of code from Shawn-SMS:</p>



<ol>
<li>Use a Proxy or VPN with geolocation that matches the country of a number;</li>



<li>Clear cookies/cache and register in a private browser tab (incognito mode);</li>



<li>Use another device or smartphone emulator.</li>



<li>Try requesting a code again.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to contact the Shawn-SMS support team?</h2>



<p>If you have tried the above-mentioned methods and still couldn’t solve the problem, then don&#8217;t hesitate to contact tech support. Here are the ways to get in touch:</p>



<p>1) Telegram: @shawnsmshq<br>2) Chat on the site: the dialog panel is on the right side of the website, but it can be disabled if there is a lot of workload on tech support.<br>3) Facebook: www.facebook.com/shawnsmshq<br>4) Instagram; @shawnsmshq<br>5) Twitter / X: twitter.com/shawnsmshq<br>6) Email support@shawnsms.com<br>7) WhatsApp: +447398747724</p>
